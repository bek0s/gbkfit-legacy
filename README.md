A high-performance software for modelling galaxy kinematics.

**gbkfit is currently being uploaded on GitHub. This process might take a few days. Until it is finished the code won't be able to compile. The initial release of the software is the one used in the paper "Kinematic Modelling of Disc Galaxies using Graphics Processing Units" (Bekiaris et al., submitted).**
