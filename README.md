A high-performance software for modelling galaxy kinematics.

**Currently the CPU-based models are available. Their GPU-based version is currently being uploaded. The initial release of the software is more or less the one used in the paper "Kinematic Modelling of Disc Galaxies using Graphics Processing Units" (Bekiaris et al., submitted).**
