A high-performance software for modelling galaxy kinematics.

**Currently both CPU- and GPU-based models are available. However the GPU models may not work with some hardware configurations. We are working towards fixing this**

The initial release of the software is more or less the one used in "Kinematic Modelling of Disc Galaxies using Graphics Processing Units", Bekiaris et al., MNRAS, (2016).
