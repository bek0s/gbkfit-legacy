Flux profile for all three mock observations: exponential
Rotation curve profile for all three mock observations: arctan

Common parameter values for all three datasets:
vsig = 50
vsys = 0
xo = 24.5
yo = 24.5
pa = 45
i0 = 1
r0 = 10
rt = 4
vt = 200

Each mock observation has a different inclination:
mock_01: incl = 20
mock_02: incl = 45
mock_03: incl = 70

All mock observations have the same dimensions, PSF, LSF and sampling:
 - Width: 49
 - Height: 49
 - PSF: gaussian, fwhm=2.5
 - LSF: gaussian, fwhm=30
 - Spatial sampling: 1.0
 - Spectral sampling: 30.0

All FITS files have three HDUs (primary + 2 extensions).

HDU 0: data
HDU 1: error
HDU 2: mask

All observations include Gaussian noise:

Velocity map noise: 5 km/s
Velocity dispersion map noise: sqrt(2) * 5 km/s

There is a "clean" version of the data with no noise and mask under 
the directory "no_noise_no_mask". Of course since the clean data have 
no noise the chi-square of fit will make no sense.
